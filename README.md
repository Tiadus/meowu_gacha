# Meowu Gacha | Ultimate Gacha Simulators For Multiple Gacha Games

# Introduction
Hello everyone, Meowu Gacha is a simulator that can simulate the gacha system of multiple gacha games, like Honkai Star Rail, in one application.
I have designed the game so that instead of the quality of the gacha animation, it will focus on efficiently computing and displaying the result of each pull.
This design allows the users to save device's resource as well as comfortably play the game at any time any where with quick loading speed.

Additonally, the user interface is designed to work on both desktop and mobile phone, enhancing users' comfortability.

Have fun and stay tune for more update with more games in the future !!!
